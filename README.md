Hello! I'm going to introduce a new practical project, this time using Python. The insights and corresponding graphs are below, the dataset is about social networks and gender.



- Concluding remarks(Read insights.txt file):

It seems there are not patterns observed.

  Gender also does not seem to be a factor that defines the time spent on social media, as the average hours are similar in all three cases.

  Gender does not appear to be a factor that defines people's salaries, as similar average salaries are observed among men, women, and non-binary individuals.

  Within the professions of Marketer Manager, Software Engineer, or Student, there does not appear to be a trend towards any gender, as they are evenly distributed with little difference among them.

  The preferred social network also does not seem to follow a pattern or trend, as both networks are usually fairly equal, except that Instagram seems to be the most popular, but by a very small margin.

  The number of individuals with a car is nearly equal.

  The number of individuals with a house is nearly equal.
In other words, gender does not seem to influence the projects or performance of these individuals.
